# 460SP
Semester Project files for ISAT 460

## Info
This repository will contain botnet files used for the semester project for
ISAT 460

## Setup
Create a few VM's

1) One VM to act as the CNC server

2) 1-4 VM's to act as bots

3) (optional) a VM to act as the client, in case you aren't running on 
a Linux host

On each VM, make sure Git is installed, then clone this repo and execute the
relevant scripts (bot or cnc) to setup the botnet

## Alternate Setup

If you don't want to/can't be bothered with installing Git on each client machine,
then instead simply download the .zip and extract it.  The URL is:
